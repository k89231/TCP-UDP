# TCP/UDP
A python project to communicate thru UDP & UDP protocol
Tested on Windows10/Jupyter Notebook

Note that:

- Use encode() and decode() function otherwise errors would emerge.
- Cellphones usually do not support UDP protocols.  I failed to test this on cellphone :(
- Failed on cellphone using TCP either :(
